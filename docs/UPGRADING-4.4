=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.2.0 and greater

The 4.4 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 4.2.2 to 4.2.3) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

plugins, L<RT::Interface::Email::Action::Take>, and
